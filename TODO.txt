-Modify the DeviceSum modules so they copy asynchrnously to page locked memory.

"Before I continue, let me do a short list of added features since v1 (some are work in progress):
-4d tensor type
-Convolutional and softmax functions
-Cuda module caching
-Automatic parallelization
-Union 4d tensor type

Asynchronous memory copies should be on that list."
